          <h1>Meet Estella Hom</h1>
          <p class="content">
            Graphic designer, kettlebell lifter, Hom Kitchen chef, and foodie. Estella was an 80’s child growing up in Downtown Toronto’s Chinatown scene, surrounded by tons of fresh produce and delicious restaurant food. Having spent most of her early childhood years hanging in her grandparents’ Chinese restaurant and sous chef to her parents while growing up, these experiences lead to a lifelong passion for food and cooking (and of course eating!).

            “The kitchen has always been my favorite room in the house. It is my happy place where I can easily spend hours on end making food and not realizing how many hours had passed.”
          </p><br />

          <p>
            After struggling with eczema skin flare ups and being overweight for years, Estella decided to finally change her diet and lifestyle. Having tried everything from steroid creams, antihistamine medicines, every skincare product, to allergy tests, only to have the problems relapse, it always came back to food. By cutting out the foods that were causing inflammation and embracing a diet filled with healthy, nutrient-packed whole foods, her skin cleared up, digestion improved, energy increased, lost weight, and she has never looked back. She realized the importance of the food we put into our bodies and how it affects how we look and feel each day.
